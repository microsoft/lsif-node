# Language Server Index Format

The purpose of the Language Server Index Format (LSIF) is it to define a standard format for language servers or other programming tools to dump their knowledge about a workspace. This dump can later be used to answer language server [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) requests for the same workspace without running the language server itself. Since much of the information would be invalidated by a change to the workspace, the dumped information typically excludes requests used when mutating a document. So, for example, the result of a code complete request is typically not part of such a dump.

A first draft specification can be found [here](./spec/specification.md).

## How to Run the tools

- `> git clone this repository`
- `> npm install`
- `> npm run compile`
- `> npm run lsif-ts` runs the indexer over the samples/typescript directory
- `> npm run lsif-ts-all` runs the indexed over the samples/typescript directory and pipes the output to the npm moniker rewriter.

Please note that the tools are work in progress and that we have not done any extensive testing so far. Known issues are:

1. Go to Declaration for function overloads doesn't honor the signature
1. Go to Type Declaration is not fully implement
1. Document link support is completely  missing
1. Reference results are not always inlined when possible

## LSIF extension

There is also an [extension for VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-lsif-extension) that can serve the content of a LSIF JSON file. Consider you have dumped the content of a workspace into an LSIF JSON file then you can use the extension to serve the supported LSP requests. This works as follows:

- follow the steps in 'How to Run the tools` above.
- clone the example you want to produce a index for into a sibling directory. For example https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-uri.git.
- cd into the workspace folder of the example.
- `> npm install`
- `> node ..\language-server-index-format\tsc-lsif\lib\main.js --outputFormat=json -p src/tsconfig.json` and pipe the output into a file. Note that under PowerShell you best do `| Out-File -Encoding ASCII lsif.json`
- `> git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-lsif-extension.git` into a sibling directory.
- `> cd vscode-lsif-extension`
- `> npm install`
- `> npm run compile`
- open the workspace using code.
- switch to the debug viewlet and launch `Launch Client`
- open the example workspace, e.g. `vscode-uri`. LSP requests like find all references or hover are served from the index dump.
